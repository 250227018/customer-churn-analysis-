📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset to understand customer behavior and identify key factors responsible for customer attrition.
The analysis is supported by clear visualizations, percentage-based insights, and business-oriented interpretations, making it easy for both technical and non-technical audiences to understand.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer churn patterns

Identify factors influencing churn

Visualize trends using charts and graphs

Provide actionable business insights

Create an executive-level summary for decision-making

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

Demographics (Gender, etc.)

Service usage details

Contract information

Monthly and total charges

Churn status (Yes / No)

📈 Key Insights (Percentage-Based)

🔴 88.30% of customers have churned

🟢 Only 11.70% of customers are retained

Early-tenure customers contribute the highest churn percentage

Gender shows minimal impact on churn

Customers with value-added services (e.g., technical support) show lower churn

Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk

📉 Visualizations Used

Pie chart for overall churn distribution

Bar charts for categorical feature comparison

Distribution plots for tenure and charges

Comparative analysis of service-based churn

Each visualization is clearly explained in the notebook and PDF report.

💡 Business Recommendations

Improve early customer onboarding

Provide retention offers for new users

Promote technical support and bundled services

Align pricing with customer-perceived value

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📄 Reports

📘 Complete EDA Report (PDF) – Detailed explanation of every chart and insight

📄 Executive Summary (PDF) – High-level business summary for stakeholders

🚀 Conclusion

This EDA clearly shows that customer churn is driven primarily by early dissatisfaction, pricing concerns, and lack of service engagement, rather than demographic factors.
The insights from this analysis can help organizations design effective retention strategies and improve long-term profitability.
